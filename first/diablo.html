    <p><font color="red" size="5"> The Lord of Terror, is the youngest brother. He was responsible for the enslavement of mankind with violent images of bloodlust and terror; his prime weapon being the victim's fear. He was originally defeated under the labyrinths beneath Tristram but corrupted the hero who slew him and sought out his brothers, but then was defeated in Hell, by the pursuing adventurer. The aura of the Lord of Terror is the most fearsome among angels and demons alike.</p>
